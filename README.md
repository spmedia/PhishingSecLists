# PhishingSecLists
To be used with scanning tools like [GoBuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster), [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf), Burp Suite, and DirBuster but these lists are specifically tailored and designed for scanning/fuzzing phishing <>< landing pages and other malicious or sketch af websites.

By finding their victim or target lists, you can help prevent further harm. If you can peer behind the curtain of their operation(s), you can dismantle em. Finding these files will give you a lot of valuable intel to pivot from or act on.

The websites of Threat Actors make perfect targets to scan and cut your teeth on. What are they gunna do? Report you to teh cops? lol

These lists were compiled by looking at the source code of all the popular phishing tool kits out there (blackeye, SET, evilginx2, zphisher, etc) to find what they saved files as, honeypots, and combing through active abuse reports + live phishing landing pages.

Languages represented in the list: Burmese, Cambodian, Chinese, English, Hindi, Indonesian, Khmer, Malay, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, Tamil, Thai.

To note: this method has a low success rate. Out of scanning 100 unique phishing/malicious websites, you may only get 4-5 hits BUT the intel you find when you do get a good valid hit is extremely valuable.

# ABOUT TEH LISTS ‚ÑπÔ∏è

**Wizard.txt** = common filenames and dirs where they might be saving captured credentials, emails, admin and control panel logins, campaign data, etc. A smorgasbord of all targeted industries like finance/crypto/banking/etc.

**Shells.txt** = popular shell file names to scan for


# EXAMPLE USAGE üëÄ

I like to use [gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) for scanning. [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) is also really nice.

Example 1:

![](https://i.imgur.com/BIYi1dr.png)

Scanning a rando phishing page I found on the [Crypto Phishing Threat Intel Feed](https://github.com/spmedia/Crypto-Scam-and-Crypto-Phishing-Threat-Intel-Feed). It lets us discover there is a `l.txt` file on root dir that contains user-agent logs. Could be useful to dig through. Could the very first IPs in the logs belong to the attackers while they were setting it up or testing it? Who else has hit this landing page? etc. It also lets us know there is a /controlpanel (commonly cPanel) and /webmail on the box.

Scam landing page

Discovery of `l.txt` that has user-agent and IP logs in it

Example 2:

Discovery of an open `/scripts/` dir on a scam landing page with some interesting files in it.

Example 3:

A scan of an "American financial firm" scam website reveals an `admin/login` page which has Chinese chars and has `<html lang="zh">` in the source. The language code zh is the ISO 639-1 standard code for the Chinese language. This lets us know the threat actors behind this scam might be Chinese.

Example 4:

A scan of a Ledger crypto scam website reveals an `a.txt` which has a list of IPs. Is this a blocklist? Is it a log of victims who have hit this site? Good thing to investigate.

Discovery of this type of info is awesome! This gives you new enhanced addtional intel to go off of for your investigation and OSINT gathering. Some people really be leaving the wildest and easiest files to discover on their scam and malicious landers.

Example 5:

While scanning a crypto exchange scam website, the discovery of a `/interface` page which leads us to a `/top` section. It's some internal invite stats system that shows how many invites have been sent out and how much each invite/user has generated the scammers. No login required to view this. The gmails look like potential victims who are wrapped up in this scam or it could even be the scammers personals emails... good data to investigate off of.

# Commands / Quick Cheat Sheet üìÉ

This is just a quick lil reference section to help you increase your odds of finding a hit and getting around certain blocks.

When using ffuf, you can dump all your phishing urls into a domains.txt and scan many websites at once to increase your hit percentages.

and then do:
##
    ffuf -w domains.txt:DOMAIN -w Wizard.txt -u DOMAIN/FUZZ -c -mc 200 -t 75

to change the ffuf user-agent (default one is straight up `Fuzz Faster U Fool` which is commonly blocked by some systems):
##
    ffuf -w Wizard.txt -u https://example.com/FUZZ -c -t 75 -mc 200 -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"             

to scan with Tor proxies + change user-agent - make sure you do `service tor start` first before scanning:
##
    ffuf -w Wizard.txt -u https://example.com/FUZZ -c -t 75 -mc 200 -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.0.0 Safari/537.36" -x socks5://127.0.0.1:9050
