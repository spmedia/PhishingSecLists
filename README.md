# PhishingSecLists
To be used with tools like GoBuster & DirBuster but these lists are specifically tailored and designed for scanning phishing <>< landing pages and other malicious or sketch af websites.

What are they gunna do? Report you to teh cops? lololo

These lists were compiled by looking at the source code of all the popular phishing tool kits out there (blackeye, SET, evilginx2, zphisher, etc) to find what they saved files as, honeypots, and combing through active abuse reports + live phishing landing pages.
